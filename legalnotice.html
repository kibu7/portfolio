      <p><strong>Disclaimer of Liability: </strong><br><br><strong>Liability for contents</strong><br><br>
        The contents of our pages were created with the greatest care. For the correctness, completeness and topicality of the contents I can take over no guarantee. As a service provider I am responsible according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG for my own
        contents on these pages according to the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information in accordance with general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete violation of the law. As soon as I
        become aware of such infringements, I will remove the content immediately.<br><br><strong>Liability for Links</strong><br><br>
        My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible
        for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal infringements at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. A permanent control of the contents of the linked
        pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. As soon as I become aware of any legal infringements, I will remove such links immediately.
        <br><br><strong>Copyright Law</strong><br><br>
        The contents and works on these pages created by the site operators are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution and any form of commercialization of such material beyond the scope of the copyright law shall
        require the prior written consent of its respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
        of third parties are respected. In particular, contents of third parties are marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly. As soon as I become aware of any infringements, I
        will remove such content immediately.
        <br><br><strong>Data Protection</strong><br><br>
        The use of our website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as on our sides personal data (for example name, address or email addresses) are raised, this takes place, as far as possible,
        always on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.<br>
        We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can be subject to security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data against access by third parties is not possible. <br>
        The use of published postal addresses, telephone or fax numbers and email addresses for marketing purposes is prohibited, offenders sending unwanted spam messages will be punished. The operators of
        Pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action against unsolicited mailing or e-mailing of spam and other similar advertising materials.<br></p><br>
